About:

This project intends to produce a MVP of a MEN Stack application performing CRUD operations on 2 associated models. It should use RESTful API practices.

In practical terms, my app is called RONR an allusion to Roberts Newly Revised Rules of Order- but it is not related directly to the book or rules in anyway that would infringe intellectual property.

What it does is provides a simple website with a private login area for regular members and boardmembers who have different levels of privilege to read and edit minutes viewable within this login area.
